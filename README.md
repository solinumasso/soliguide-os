# Export Soliguide data to lists

## Introduction
This project's purpose, as its name states, is to allow to export Soliguide's data to lists.

These lists can have different format. They can be exported as CSV, as PDF... During the process, the data will be transformed to be readable by humans.

The exports functions will go along with a visual input (a button) and a popup to confirm in which format the data should be exported.

⚠️ Currently, this project is only usable with Soliguide.
